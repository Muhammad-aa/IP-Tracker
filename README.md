# IP-Tracker
This programs helps us geolaocate (track the location) of any valid IP address. So we know where they are reaching out from.
With this program, we know the country, city and even street address of the taget or user.
Please bear in mind that the accuracy of the geolocation, depends on the quality of geodate of the target/user's region.
To use, navigate to the directory on your terminal and type: python ip_tracker.py --ip [target's ip]
You can also use 'python ip_tracker.py --help' to see the usage of the program. 
Also, ip_tracker is the name of my python file. Replace that with whatever you named your program with.
